      <H2>WHY TRAINING</H2>
      <BR>
        Today's IT industry requirements are completely different from the one taught in colleges.Colleges will help to you get the degree with the knowledge been provided on many subjects but in bits and pieces.And the real time industry needs a specialist or can say expert in a particular domain or field or technology.
We at Sunsoft Technologies try to remove this gap and make a candidate to enhance his skills to expertise and expel in the technology which is required by the real IT indudtry and overcome the problems which they might have faced without training.
